This research examines how the accuracy of a Hate Speech Classification Using Logistic Regression model fluctuates when trained on one dataset and tested on various other datasets. The key research question is whether a model trained on a single dataset shows significant differences in accuracy when evaluated on multiple external datasets. To understand this, we implemented a comparative analysis by training the model on a designated dataset and then testing its accuracy on several distinct datasets. Additionally, we constructed a model using a combined dataset derived from multiple sources improve its accuracy. The results indicate that the model's accuracy varies based on the test dataset, underscoring the limitations of training on a single dataset. The model trained on the combined dataset showed enhanced accuracy, demonstrating that utilizing diverse datasets for training contributes to better model performance. We propose that integrating data from various sources is important for achieving more accurate and reliable Hate Speech Classification models.
